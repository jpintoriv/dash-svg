     *       Percentages represent values relative to the current

    This value indicates that the user coordinate

     *  the gradient element is referenced (i.e., the user coordinate
     *  system for the element referencing the gradient element
     *  via a fill or stroke property) and then applying the transform
     *  specified by attribute gradientTransform.
      for <radialGradient>:
     *  the user coordinate system for attributes cx, cy, r, fx,
     *  fy, and fr is established using the bounding box of the
     *  element to which the gradient is applied (see Object bounding
     *  box units) and then applying the transform specified by
     *  attribute gradientTransform.
      With this value and
     *  gradientTransform being the identity matrix, the rings
     *  of the radial gradient are circular with respect to the
     *  object bounding box space (i.e., the abstract coordinate
     *  system where (0,0) is at the top/left of the object bounding
     *  box and (1,1) is at the bottom/right of the object bounding
     *  box). When the object's bounding box is not square, the
     *  rings that are conceptually circular within object bounding
     *  box space will render as elliptical due to application
     *  of the non-uniform scaling transformation from bounding
     *  box space to user space.
