     *  If no value is provided and this is a subsequent filter
     *  primitive, then this filter primitive will use the result
     *  from the previous filter primitive as its input.If the
     *  value for result appears multiple times within a given
     *  <filter> element, then a reference to that result will
     *  use the closest preceding filter primitive with the given
     *  value for attribute result.You can use this attribute
     *  with the following SVG elements:This keyword represents
     *  the graphics elements that were the original input into
     *  the <filter> element.This keyword represents the graphics
     *  elements that were the original input into the <filter>
     *  element. SourceAlpha has all of the same rules as SourceGraphic
     *  except that only the alpha channel is used.This keyword
     *  represents an image snapshot of the SVG document under
     *  the filter region at the time that the <filter> element
     *  was invoked.Same as BackgroundImage except only the alpha
     *  channel is used.This keyword represents the value of the
     *  fill property on the target element for the filter effect.
     *  In many cases, the FillPaint is opaque everywhere, but
     *  that might not be the case if a shape is painted with
     *  a gradient or pattern which itself includes transparent
     *  or semi-transparent parts.This keyword represents the
     *  value of the stroke property on the target element for
     *  the filter effect. In many cases, the StrokePaint is opaque
     *  everywhere, but that might not be the case if a shape
     *  is painted with a gradient or pattern which itself includes
     *  transparent or semi-transparent parts.This value is an
     *  assigned name for the filter primitive in the form of
     *  a <custom-ident>. If supplied, then graphics that result
     *  from processing this filter primitive can be referenced
     *  by an in attribute on a subsequent filter primitive within
     *  the same filter element. If no value is provided, the
     *  output will only be available for re-use as the implicit
     *  input into the next filter primitive if that filter primitive
     *  provides no value for its in attribute.BackgroundImage
     *  is not supported as a filter source in modern browsers
     *  (see the feComposite compatibility table). We therefore
     *  need to import one of the images to blend inside the filter
     *  itself, using an <feImage> element.Note: Firefox Bug 455986
     *  means that feImage cannot load partial images, including
     *  circles, rectangles, paths or other fragments defined
     *  in the document. So that this example works on more browsers,
     *  a full external image of the logo is loaded.Last modified:
